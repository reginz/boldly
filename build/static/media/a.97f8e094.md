# Do Things That Will Surpass Your Life

Lately, the fact that I'm going to die one day very much bothered me. We all know that finally, the end will come to us. But I wondered why I am so annoyed by that. And after a while of thinking, I found that 'ancient' issue that I -and maybe we all should focus on. It's,  did I leave a footprint in the past after I died? Did I spend my life for something that would surpass itself? 

These questions are very important, because humanity grows with knowledge and knowledge with accumulation. What matters is how much we can contribute to this pool of knowledge, in other words, how much we can produce and how much we can inspire other people to do so. Only in this way, I think we can do things that surpass ourselves.

Luckily there are thousands of ways to produce. So, with this blog I wanted to give myself a change to create content, with knowing that I am not the most qualified person to talk about stuff that I will write. But I don't find that important as long as I am seeking for truth and speaking the facts. 

And also I find the process of creating content both energizing and questioning. 
It is amazing to share and develop the ideas that we synthesized in our brains with each other.
